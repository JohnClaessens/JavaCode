/* John Claessens
 * The purpose of this program is to:
 * Create a Java application that implements use of an int array. 
 * Use for loops to iterate through the array using the arrayâ€™s length variable to stay within the array bounds.
 * Fill the array with random numbers and print the array.

 * Assignment 7.2
 * Some of the code in this program may be similiar to code found in Introduction to Java Programming by Y. Daniel Liang
